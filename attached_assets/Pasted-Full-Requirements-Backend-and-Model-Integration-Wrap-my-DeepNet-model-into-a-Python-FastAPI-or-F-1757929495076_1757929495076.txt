Full Requirements:

Backend and Model Integration:

Wrap my DeepNet model into a Python FastAPI or Flask service.

Create a robust API to serve predictions in real time (REST or WebSocket).

Run the model continuously in the background to process incoming traffic.

Real-Time Data Pipeline:

Replace simulated inputs with actual network traffic capture using tools like scapy, pyshark, or similar libraries.

Implement a secure and efficient stream to send live packet data to the backend for inference.

Frontend Updates:

Update the React dashboard to dynamically fetch and render predictions.

Include live charts, alerts, logs, and an intuitive UI for security teams.

Infrastructure and Deployment:

Write a Dockerfile for the backend and a docker-compose.yml for the whole stack.

Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or equivalent) for automated builds and deployments.

Deploy the entire system to a production environment (AWS ECS/EC2, Azure, Render, or Railway).

Database Integration:

Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store traffic logs, predictions, and alerts.

Include endpoints for retrieving historical data for analysis.

Security and Scaling:

Add authentication to access the dashboard.

Ensure secure handling of network logs (encryption, no sensitive data leaks).

Optimize for large-scale network traffic handling.

Documentation:

Write a README.md with setup, usage, and deployment instructions.

Include code comments, system architecture diagrams, and API documentation.

Tech Stack Preferences:

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Python (FastAPI preferred)

Model: PyTorch-based DeepNet anomaly detection

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Deployment: Docker + AWS (or similar cloud platform)

Deliverables:

A fully deployed web application with:

Integrated and continuously running DeepNet model.

Real-time traffic capture, processing, and anomaly detection.

Fully updated frontend displaying live data and alerts.

Secure authentication and scalable infrastructure.

Complete source code, configuration files, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment scripts.

Documentation on how to run, maintain, and extend the platform.
