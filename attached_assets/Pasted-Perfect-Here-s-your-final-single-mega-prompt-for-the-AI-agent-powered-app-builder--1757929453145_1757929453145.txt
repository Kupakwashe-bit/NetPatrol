### ðŸ§© Mega Prompt for AI Agent App Builder

> **Objective:** Transform my existing DeepNet-based anomaly detection project into a **fully functional, production-ready web application** that is live, deployed, and capable of processing **real-time network traffic data** with a DeepNet model running in the background.
>
> ---
>
> **Current Setup:**
>
> * Frontend: React dashboard that currently displays **simulated data** only.
> * Backend: Basic Python endpoints, no live data integration.
> * Model: DeepNet anomaly detection model built in Python (PyTorch or TensorFlow), currently offline in Jupyter notebooks.
> * Goal: Detect network failures or security anomalies from **live network traffic logs** and visualize results in real time.
>
> ---
>
> **Full Requirements:**
>
> 1. **Backend and Model Integration:**
>
>    * Wrap my DeepNet model into a Python FastAPI or Flask service.
>    * Create a robust API to serve predictions in real time (REST or WebSocket).
>    * Run the model continuously in the background to process incoming traffic.
> 2. **Real-Time Data Pipeline:**
>
>    * Replace simulated inputs with **actual network traffic capture** using tools like `scapy`, `pyshark`, or similar libraries.
>    * Implement a secure and efficient stream to send live packet data to the backend for inference.
> 3. **Frontend Updates:**
>
>    * Update the React dashboard to dynamically fetch and render predictions.
>    * Include live charts, alerts, logs, and an intuitive UI for security teams.
> 4. **Infrastructure and Deployment:**
>
>    * Write a `Dockerfile` for the backend and a `docker-compose.yml` for the whole stack.
>    * Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or equivalent) for automated builds and deployments.
>    * Deploy the entire system to a production environment (AWS ECS/EC2, Azure, Render, or Railway).
> 5. **Database Integration:**
>
>    * Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store traffic logs, predictions, and alerts.
>    * Include endpoints for retrieving historical data for analysis.
> 6. **Security and Scaling:**
>
>    * Add authentication to access the dashboard.
>    * Ensure secure handling of network logs (encryption, no sensitive data leaks).
>    * Optimize for large-scale network traffic handling.
> 7. **Documentation:**
>
>    * Write a `README.md` with setup, usage, and deployment instructions.
>    * Include code comments, system architecture diagrams, and API documentation.
>
> ---
>
> **Tech Stack Preferences:**
>
> * Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
> * Backend: Python (FastAPI preferred)
> * Model: PyTorch-based DeepNet anomaly detection
> * Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
> * Deployment: Docker + AWS (or similar cloud platform)
>
> ---
>
> **Deliverables:**
>
> * A **fully deployed web application** with:
>
>   * Integrated and continuously running DeepNet model.
>   * Real-time traffic capture, processing, and anomaly detection.
>   * Fully updated frontend displaying live data and alerts.
>   * Secure authentication and scalable infrastructure.
> * Complete source code, configuration files, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment scripts.
> * Documentation on how to run, maintain, and extend the platform.
>
> ---
>
> **Your Task:** Generate **all necessary code, configuration files, infrastructure scripts, and setup instructions** to deliver the above system as a **production-ready, live-deployed solution**.

This is polished, **agent-friendly**, and specific enough for an AI builder to handle everything end-to-end.

Would you also like me to **write a quick 2â€“3 sentence context summary** to give the AI agent before this mega prompt (to make sure it understands your overall project vision)?
